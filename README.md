This Python script creates a basic keylogger that records keystrokes and saves them to a file. It begins by importing the keyboard module from the pynput library, which is used to monitor and manage keyboard inputs.

The script defines a function called keyPressed that handles key press events. Inside this function, it prints the key pressed to the console for visibility and opens a file named keylog.txt in append mode to log the character representation of each key. If the key does not have a character representation or an error occurs, the function will print an error message.

The script sets up a listener that calls the keyPressed function whenever a key is pressed. It keeps running continuously by using the input() function, allowing it to operate in the background until the user manually stops it.

In summary, this keylogger script uses the pynput library to capture and record keystrokes in a file, running persistently until manually terminated by the user.
